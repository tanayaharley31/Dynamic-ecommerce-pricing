Dynamic E-commerce Pricing using Machine Learning on the Olist Brazilian E-commerce Dataset Building predictive pricing models and analyzing customer/market behavior to simulate real-world retail pricing strategies.

# Dynamic E-commerce Pricing using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores **dynamic pricing strategies in e-commerce** by applying data-driven machine learning techniques. Using the [Olist Brazilian E-commerce dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce), we analyze customer behavior, product demand, and market conditions to design pricing models that adjust in real-time.

The goal is to **simulate how online retailers (like Amazon, Flipkart, or Uber) dynamically adjust prices** to maximize revenue, improve competitiveness, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand and preprocess a real-world large-scale e-commerce dataset.
* Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to extract customer and market insights.
* Build and evaluate **predictive models** for pricing strategies.
* Simulate dynamic pricing under different scenarios (demand surge, low inventory, seasonal changes).
* Draw insights on the **business value of dynamic pricing** in e-commerce.
